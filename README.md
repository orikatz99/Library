# Library - C++ ðŸ“š ðŸ“–
**This is the second part of my final project for the C++ course, completed at Afka College.**

**To the first part :**  [README.md](https://github.com/orikatz99/Taxi_Company-/blob/main/README.md)

**To the third part :**  [README.md](https://github.com/orikatz99/Taxi_Company-/blob/main/README.md)

In this part, we were required to choose a project that someone else had written (the first part of someone else's project) and fully implement it.  
We chose "Library Management."

**In this part, we were not allowed to use STL or templates.**

The goal of this part was to work with code written by someone else, ensure we fully understand the project, and make corrections as needed.  
We had to deal with errors in the initial structure and modify things where necessary (as detailed in the report).  
Additionally, there was no main function in this project, so we had to add one.
